    "text": "Introduction\nBEMTOOL is an integrated bioeconomic modelling tool that follows a multi-fleet and multiple species approach, simulating the effects of management scenarios on stocks and fisheries (Rossetto et al. (2015) and Bitetto et al.(2025)). Such effects in mixed fisheries are measured by a suite of indicators with associated uncertainty. BEMTOOL was previously implemented, within FAIRSEA project (https://www.italy-croatia.eu/web/fairsea), in the Adriatic and western Ionian Seas (GFCM Geographical Sub Areas - GSAs 17, 18 and 19, Figure 1) to inform and support the modelling of indicators, targets and limits, linked to the management of key stocks: European hake (HKE), red mullet (MUT) and deep water rose shrimp (DPS).\nThe data required are for the most part publicly available and are mainly stock assessment results, transversal data (e.g. effort, landing), socio-economic data, other relevant information (e.g. historical management measures applied).\nBEMTOOL model has been peer-reviewed in a number of contexts, through a number of applications in Mediterranean Sea under EU funded projects and STECF experts Working groups, including the Western Med MAP STECF EWGs where BEMTOOL is routinely applied since 2019. The tool was used also in the communication with relevant stakeholders in many contexts.\n\n\n\nIn SEAwise the model has been enhanced covering 24 fleet segments, that which encompass both active and passive gears targeting demersal resources, and 10 key target stocks: European hake in GSAs 17-18, European hake in GSA 19, Red mullet in GSAs 17-18, Red mullet in GSA 19, Deep-water rose shrimp in GSAs 17-18-19, Common sole in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 18, giant red shrimp in GSAs 18-19 and blue and red shrimp in GSAs 18-19. These stocks are among the main target of the fisheries and of the Multi Annual Management Plan in the Adriatic region (GFCM Recommendations GFCM/43/2019/5; GFCM/44/2021/1). In the GSA19 a MAP for demersal stocks is not yet in place. However, considering the possible connectivity of the populations in the whole area (Spedicato et al. (2022)) also HKE and MUT in GSA19 were included in this analysis."

An example of selectivity file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. See also chapter 12.1 of the manual for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in effort: the change in effort has to be parameterized providing in the BEMTOOL GUI the cvs file for the number of vessels and the number of fishing days by month and year. The GT and KW for the fleets are assumed the same of the last year of simulation. An example of fishing day and vessel file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. The change in effort can be also parameterised using the GUI (see chapter 12.2), through a smart facility."
