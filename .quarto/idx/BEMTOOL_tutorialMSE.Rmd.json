(2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X1400298X) and [Bitetto et al.(2025)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0382)). Such effects in mixed fisheries are measured by a suite of indicators with associated uncertainty. \nBEMTOOL was previously implemented, within FAIRSEA project (https://www.italy-croatia.eu/web/fairsea), in the Adriatic and western Ionian Seas (GFCM Geographical Sub Areas - GSAs 17, 18 and 19, Figure 1) to inform and support the modelling of indicators, targets and limits, linked to the management of key stocks: European hake (HKE), red mullet (MUT) and deep water rose shrimp (DPS). \n\nThe data required are for the most part publicly available and are mainly stock assessment results, transversal data (e.g. effort, landing), socio-economic data, other relevant information (e.g. historical management measures applied). \n\nBEMTOOL model has been peer-reviewed in a number of contexts, through a number of applications in Mediterranean Sea under EU funded projects and STECF experts Working groups, including the [Western Med MAP STECF EWGs](https://stecf.ec.europa.eu/reports/management-plans_en) where BEMTOOL is routinely applied since 2019. The tool was used also in the communication with relevant stakeholders in many contexts.\n\n```{r fig1, include=FALSE}\ncat('<div style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:0.5rem;\">\nFigure 1- Maps of the Adriatic and western Ionian Sea Geographical Sub-Areas (GSAs): 17, 18 and 19.\n</div>')\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"map.png\" width=\"60%\">\n</p>\n\nIn SEAwise the model has been enhanced covering 24 fleet segments, that which encompass both active and passive gears targeting demersal resources, and 10 key target stocks: European hake in GSAs 17-18, European hake in GSA 19, Red mullet in GSAs 17-18, Red mullet in GSA 19, Deep-water rose shrimp in GSAs 17-18-19, Common sole in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 18, giant red shrimp in GSAs 18-19 and blue and red shrimp in GSAs 18-19.\nThese stocks are among the main target of the fisheries and of the Multi Annual Management Plan in the Adriatic region (GFCM Recommendations GFCM/43/2019/5; GFCM/44/2021/1). In the GSA19 a MAP for demersal stocks is not yet in place. However, considering the possible connectivity of the populations in the whole area ([Spedicato et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.2926/909535)) also HKE and MUT in GSA19 were included in this analysis.\n\n\n# Application of BEMTOOL in WP6\n\nIn SEAwise WP6 BEMTOOL model has been applied including enhancements made in WP2 (socio-economic impacts of and on fishing) and WP3 (Ecological effects on fisheries) and, specifically:\n\n1) enhanced fish price sub-models and variable costs (e.g fuel) disaggregated by metier (see [tutorial task 2.2](https://seawiseproject.org/open_online_course/modelling_social_economic_effects/));\n2) environmentally-mediated stock recruitment relationships (EMSRR), allowing to model effects of climate change on stock productivity (see [tutorial on recruitment EMSRR estimation](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/tree/main/recruitment).\n\nThe climate change has been then combined with the a number of management measures, focused on effort control measures aligned with GFCM Multiannual Plans, including status quo effort, effort reduction to reach FMSY or F0.1, and multi-species PGY strategies. Additionally, management measures such as gear selectivity improvements, spatial closures and (e.g., reallocation of effort between static and mobile gears) were explored to assess their implications on economic performance, employment, and carbon emissions.\n\nIn the BEMTOOL operating model, the population dynamic is simulated by Aladym model ([Lembo et al.(2009)](https://www.alr-journal.org/articles/alr/pdf/2009/02/alr006-09.pdf)) for all the stocks considered without interaction among them. The model at present can be considered a short-cut of type 1, with an estimation emulator that add error to the simulated population outcomes. Different sources of uncertainty can be included a part of recruitment: on sexual maturity, growth, M (linked to the growth), fleet selectivity. The model works by sex and month and includes length information of the population. A number of management scenarios can be simulated, including gear selectivity, spatio-temporal closures, catch limits and combinations of the measures. A number of indicators are provided, in particular the model estimates biological, pressure and socio-economic indicators and provide a number of alternative economic sub-models on price and costs to estimate properly the relevant economic performance by fleet. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"BMT_scheme.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n# Required packages\n\nIn order to run BEMTOOL you should have the following packages installed:\n\nfrom zip: ALADYMTools (available on WP6 github)\n\nfrom Cran:gridExtra, akima, stringr, Hmisc, timeDate,reshape, scales, FLBRP\n\nfrom http://flrproject.org/R: FLCore, ggplot2, FLasher\n\n```{r packages, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,results=FALSE}\n# iterators\nif (!(\"iterators\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"iterators\")\n}\n\n\nif (!(\"FLCore\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    #install.packages(\"FLCore\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n  remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLCore\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"ggplot2\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"gridExtra\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"gridExtra\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"akima\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"akima\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"stringr\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"stringr\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"RGtk2\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"RGtk2\")\n}\n\n\nif (!(\"Hmisc\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"Hmisc\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"timeDate\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"timeDate\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"reshape\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"reshape\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"scales\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"scales\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"tryCatchLog\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"tryCatchLog\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLasher\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"FLasher\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLBRP\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n   # install.packages(\"FLBRP\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n    remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLBRP\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLasher\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n   # install.packages(\"FLBRP\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n    remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLasher\")\n}\n\n```\n\n\n# RGtk2 installation\n\nA specific procedure has to be carried out to install RGtk2:\n\n1.\tDownload GTK+ dependencies (gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip file) from https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/ \n2.\tUnzip it to the path of your choice.\n\nATTENTION!!!!: Using either Windows Explorer's built-in zip file management, or the command-line unzip.exe, available for instance at\nftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/WIN32/unz552xN.exe unzip this bundle.

Click on NEXT button and verify that all the data (biological, economic, etc...) are correctly read; click 3 times on NEXT and finally click on \"RUN new diagnosis\";\n\n3. When the ALADYM GUI appears, click on \"Load simulation parameters\" and select the file \"INPUT/ALADYM/configuration file_ALADYM -HKE GSA 17-18.csv\" and then click on RUN simulation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"aladym_GUI.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n4.

It is set a SQ scenario.\n\nTo parameterize all the economic functions in the projections, refer to the [BEMTOOL manual](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/blob/main/BEMTOOL/BEMTOOL%202%200%20-%20User%20Handbook_29052015_DRAFT.pdf). \nConsider that the for parameterizing the fish price functions and the variable costs, a dedicated tutorial was developed [SEAwise – Fish price & Variable costs](https://coispa.github.io/Fish-price-and-variable-costs/Enhanced_fishprice_fuelcosts_submodels.html).\n\nSeveral management strategies can be simulated in BEMTOOL, also in combination with the impact of climate change on recruitment:\n\n- Change in Selectivity: after selecting Change in selectivity scenario (or combining change in selectivity with other scenarios) from the GUI or from the bmfconfig csv file, we could change the selectivity in the ALADYM GUI, each time that a species GUI will open. An example of selectivity file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. See also chapter 12.1 of the manual for further details.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"selectivity.png\" width=\"90%\">\n</p>\n\n\n- Change in effort: the change in effort has to be parameterized providing in the BEMTOOL GUI the cvs file for the number of vessels and the number of fishing days by month and year. The GT and KW for the fleets are assumed the same of the last year of simulation. An example of fishing day and vessel file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. The change in effort can be also parameterised using the GUI (see chapter 12.2), through a smart facility.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"smartGUI.png\" width=\"90%\">\n</p>\n\n## How to integrate climate change through EMSRR\n\nTo integrate the environmental variables, and then the climate, on the stock recruitment relationships and in the projections, SEAwise BEMTOOL model built on the work made in WP3, described in  [Bitetto et al.(2025)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0382). \n\n\nBefore clicking on Run NEW scenario, select the grid for environmental projections for the years of simulations (in our case until 2040) from the GUI.\nOpen the script \"runCI.r\" in the folder (lines 628-650): \n\n```{r path, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n\n#\"C:\\Training\\BMT_Nov2024\\src\\biol\\bmtALADYM\\ALADYM-ver12.3-2017_0501\\src\" \n\n```\n\nThis modification of the files will change according to the climate change scenario.Below an example without clmate change:\n\n```{r modify the RCP scenario, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n\n# DO IT in the script, here it is reported only an example!\n\n#Folder: \"C:\\Training\\BMT_Nov2024\\src\\biol\\bmtALADYM\\ALADYM-ver12.3-2017_0501\\src\"\n\n\nBMT_SPECIES= c(\"M.mer1718\" ,  \"M.mer19\"    , \"M.bar1718\"   ,\"M.bar19\"   ,  \"P.lon171819\")\nALADYM_spe=1\n\nif(BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.mer1718\" ){\n  \n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\HKE1718_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.mer19\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\HKE19_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month_2.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.bar1718\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\MUT1718_10-200_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.bar19\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\MUT19_10_200_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"P.lon171819\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\DPS17181920_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n}\n\nhead(ENV)\n\n```\n\nThis table could potentially contain different values for each month in the year.\n\n# Modify RFSS script with the coefficients of the EMSRR\n\nIn the function containing the equations of the SRR, we included all the coefficients by stock except a and b (that are in the grid defined above). \n\nFor the estimation of the EMSRR coefficients on your own data, refer to the [WP3 tutorial](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/tree/main/recruitment). \n\nFolder: path reported in the code below.\n\nThese coefficients will not change with the climate change scenario.\n\n```{r modify the RFSS script, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n# DO IT in the script!!

(2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X1400298X) and [Bitetto et al.(2025)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0382)). Such effects in mixed fisheries are measured by a suite of indicators with associated uncertainty. \nBEMTOOL was previously implemented, within FAIRSEA project (https://www.italy-croatia.eu/web/fairsea), in the Adriatic and western Ionian Seas (GFCM Geographical Sub Areas - GSAs 17, 18 and 19, Figure 1) to inform and support the modelling of indicators, targets and limits, linked to the management of key stocks: European hake (HKE), red mullet (MUT) and deep water rose shrimp (DPS). \n\nThe data required are for the most part publicly available and are mainly stock assessment results, transversal data (e.g. effort, landing), socio-economic data, other relevant information (e.g. historical management measures applied). \n\nBEMTOOL model has been peer-reviewed in a number of contexts, through a number of applications in Mediterranean Sea under EU funded projects and STECF experts Working groups, including the [Western Med MAP STECF EWGs](https://stecf.ec.europa.eu/reports/management-plans_en) where BEMTOOL is routinely applied since 2019. The tool was used also in the communication with relevant stakeholders in many contexts.\n\n```{r fig1, include=FALSE}\ncat('<div style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:0.5rem;\">\nFigure 1- Maps of the Adriatic and western Ionian Sea Geographical Sub-Areas (GSAs): 17, 18 and 19.\n</div>')\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"map.png\" width=\"60%\">\n</p>\n\nIn SEAwise the model has been enhanced covering 24 fleet segments, that which encompass both active and passive gears targeting demersal resources, and 10 key target stocks: European hake in GSAs 17-18, European hake in GSA 19, Red mullet in GSAs 17-18, Red mullet in GSA 19, Deep-water rose shrimp in GSAs 17-18-19, Common sole in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 17, Norway lobster in GSA 18, giant red shrimp in GSAs 18-19 and blue and red shrimp in GSAs 18-19.\nThese stocks are among the main target of the fisheries and of the Multi Annual Management Plan in the Adriatic region (GFCM Recommendations GFCM/43/2019/5; GFCM/44/2021/1). In the GSA19 a MAP for demersal stocks is not yet in place. However, considering the possible connectivity of the populations in the whole area ([Spedicato et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.2926/909535)) also HKE and MUT in GSA19 were included in this analysis.\n\n\n# Application of BEMTOOL in WP6\n\nIn SEAwise WP6 BEMTOOL model has been applied including enhancements made in WP2 (socio-economic impacts of and on fishing) and WP3 (Ecological effects on fisheries) and, specifically:\n\n1) enhanced fish price sub-models and variable costs (e.g fuel) disaggregated by metier (see [tutorial task 2.2](https://seawiseproject.org/open_online_course/modelling_social_economic_effects/));\n2) environmentally-mediated stock recruitment relationships (EMSRR), allowing to model effects of climate change on stock productivity (see [tutorial on recruitment EMSRR estimation](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/tree/main/recruitment).\n\nThe climate change has been then combined with the a number of management measures, focused on effort control measures aligned with GFCM Multiannual Plans, including status quo effort, effort reduction to reach FMSY or F0.1, and multi-species PGY strategies. Additionally, management measures such as gear selectivity improvements, spatial closures and (e.g., reallocation of effort between static and mobile gears) were explored to assess their implications on economic performance, employment, and carbon emissions.\n\nIn the BEMTOOL operating model, the population dynamic is simulated by Aladym model ([Lembo et al.(2009)](https://www.alr-journal.org/articles/alr/pdf/2009/02/alr006-09.pdf)) for all the stocks considered without interaction among them. The model at present can be considered a short-cut of type 1, with an estimation emulator that add error to the simulated population outcomes. Different sources of uncertainty can be included a part of recruitment: on sexual maturity, growth, M (linked to the growth), fleet selectivity. The model works by sex and month and includes length information of the population. A number of management scenarios can be simulated, including gear selectivity, spatio-temporal closures, catch limits and combinations of the measures. A number of indicators are provided, in particular the model estimates biological, pressure and socio-economic indicators and provide a number of alternative economic sub-models on price and costs to estimate properly the relevant economic performance by fleet. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"BMT_scheme.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n# Required packages\n\nIn order to run BEMTOOL you should have the following packages installed:\n\nfrom zip: ALADYMTools (available on WP6 github)\n\nfrom Cran:gridExtra, akima, stringr, Hmisc, timeDate,reshape, scales, FLBRP\n\nfrom http://flrproject.org/R: FLCore, ggplot2, FLasher\n\n```{r packages, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,results=FALSE}\n# iterators\nif (!(\"iterators\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"iterators\")\n}\n\n\nif (!(\"FLCore\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    #install.packages(\"FLCore\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n  remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLCore\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"ggplot2\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"gridExtra\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"gridExtra\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"akima\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"akima\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"stringr\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"stringr\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"RGtk2\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"RGtk2\")\n}\n\n\nif (!(\"Hmisc\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"Hmisc\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"timeDate\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"timeDate\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"reshape\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"reshape\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"scales\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"scales\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"tryCatchLog\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"tryCatchLog\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLasher\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n    install.packages(\"FLasher\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLBRP\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n   # install.packages(\"FLBRP\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n    remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLBRP\")\n}\n\nif (!(\"FLasher\" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {\n   # install.packages(\"FLBRP\",repos=\"http://flrproject.org/R\")\n    remotes::install_github(\"flr/FLasher\")\n}\n\n```\n\n\n# RGtk2 installation\n\nA specific procedure has to be carried out to install RGtk2:\n\n1.\tDownload GTK+ dependencies (gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip file) from https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/ \n2.\tUnzip it to the path of your choice.\n\nATTENTION!!!!: Using either Windows Explorer's built-in zip file management, or the command-line unzip.exe, available for instance at\nftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/WIN32/unz552xN.exe unzip this bundle.

Click on NEXT button and verify that all the data (biological, economic, etc...) are correctly read; click 3 times on NEXT and finally click on \"RUN new diagnosis\";\n\n3. When the ALADYM GUI appears, click on \"Load simulation parameters\" and select the file \"INPUT/ALADYM/configuration file_ALADYM -HKE GSA 17-18.csv\" and then click on RUN simulation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"aladym_GUI.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n4. In the console you can see the steps of running the reference points for stock 1; when it finishes, the ALADYM GUI for the second stock (hake 19) will appear.

It is set a SQ scenario.\n\nTo parameterize all the economic functions in the projections, refer to the [BEMTOOL manual](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/blob/main/BEMTOOL/BEMTOOL%202%200%20-%20User%20Handbook_29052015_DRAFT.pdf). \nConsider that the for parameterizing the fish price functions and the variable costs, a dedicated tutorial was developed [SEAwise – Fish price & Variable costs](https://coispa.github.io/Fish-price-and-variable-costs/Enhanced_fishprice_fuelcosts_submodels.html).\n\nSeveral management strategies can be simulated in BEMTOOL, also in combination with the impact of climate change on recruitment:\n\n- Change in Selectivity: after selecting Change in selectivity scenario (or combining change in selectivity with other scenarios) from the GUI or from the bmfconfig csv file, we could change the selectivity in the ALADYM GUI, each time that a species GUI will open. An example of selectivity file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. See also chapter 12.1 of the manual for further details.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"selectivity.png\" width=\"90%\">\n</p>\n\n\n- Change in effort: the change in effort has to be parameterized providing in the BEMTOOL GUI the cvs file for the number of vessels and the number of fishing days by month and year. The GT and KW for the fleets are assumed the same of the last year of simulation. An example of fishing day and vessel file is provided in the github Med case study repository, under BEMTOOL directory. The change in effort can be also parameterised using the GUI (see chapter 12.2), through a smart facility.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"smartGUI.png\" width=\"90%\">\n</p>\n\n## How to integrate climate change through EMSRR\n\nTo integrate the environmental variables, and then the climate, on the stock recruitment relationships and in the projections, SEAwise BEMTOOL model built on the work made in WP3, described in  [Bitetto et al.(2025)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0382). \n\n\nBefore clicking on Run NEW scenario, select the grid for environmental projections for the years of simulations (in our case until 2040) from the GUI.\nOpen the script \"runCI.r\" in the folder (lines 628-650): \n\n```{r path, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n\n#\"C:\\Training\\BMT_Nov2024\\src\\biol\\bmtALADYM\\ALADYM-ver12.3-2017_0501\\src\" \n\n```\n\nThis modification of the files will change according to the climate change scenario.Below an example without clmate change:\n\n```{r modify the RCP scenario, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n\n# DO IT in the script, here it is reported only an example!\n\n#Folder: \"C:\\Training\\BMT_Nov2024\\src\\biol\\bmtALADYM\\ALADYM-ver12.3-2017_0501\\src\"\n\n\nBMT_SPECIES= c(\"M.mer1718\" ,  \"M.mer19\"    , \"M.bar1718\"   ,\"M.bar19\"   ,  \"P.lon171819\")\nALADYM_spe=1\n\nif(BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.mer1718\" ){\n  \n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\HKE1718_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.mer19\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\HKE19_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month_2.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.bar1718\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\MUT1718_10-200_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"M.bar19\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\MUT19_10_200_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n  \n} else if (BMT_SPECIES[ALADYM_spe]==\"P.lon171819\" ){\n  ENV<<-read.table(\"C:\\\\Training\\\\INPUT\\\\ENVIRONMENTAL_GRIDS\\\\DPS17181920_50_500_NoCC_bia_adj_month.csv\",sep=\";\",header=T)  \n}\n\nhead(ENV)\n\n```\n\nThis table could potentially contain different values for each month in the year.\n\n# Modify RFSS script with the coefficients of the EMSRR\n\nIn the function containing the equations of the SRR, we included all the coefficients by stock except a and b (that are in the grid defined above). \n\nFor the estimation of the EMSRR coefficients on your own data, refer to the [WP3 tutorial](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise_ecoMSE/tree/main/recruitment). \n\nFolder: path reported in the code below.\n\nThese coefficients will not change with the climate change scenario.\n\n```{r modify the RFSS script, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n# DO IT in the script!!
